I saw about spider web shaped object based generative art code on medium before, so that was one of my goal to understand and find out how to draw and handle objects. Rule was so simple that random points are connected if their distance is below 100 pixels. Then tried to vanish on the edge by adding one more simple rule that if they are far from the center, then they don't just connect each other.
